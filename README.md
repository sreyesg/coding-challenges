## About

This series of coding challenges is meant to supplement the student learning journey. The content ranges from fundamental JavaScript topics, such as basic syntax and data types, to more advanced subjects, including array and object manipulation.

These challenges are designed to progressively build the learners' skills, offering a diverse array of tasks that cater to both beginners and those looking to reinforce existing language skills. The challenges start with simpler tasks and gradually increase in complexity.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete these coding challenges, learners should have foundational knowledge in the following areas:
